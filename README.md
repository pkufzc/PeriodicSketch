PeriodicSketch
============

Introduction
--------
Periodic is an important pattern in data streams, and periodic items refers to those items which arrive with a fixed interval. Any interval may occur many times, we use recurrence to denote the number of occurrence of an interval. Finding periodic items is a new and important issue in data streams mining, but there is no study carried out at present. To find periodic items, we propose a novel sketch, PeriodicSketch, aiming to accurately record top-ùêæ periodic items. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to find periodic items. To pick out periodic items with higher probability, we propose a key technique called Guaranteed Soft Uniform replacement strategy (GSU). Our theoretical proofs show that when replacement is successful, it is more likely that the new item has a higher recurrence than the current smallest recurrence; and GSU can ensure that our items in the sketch will approach the true periodic items closer and closer. And as soon as we get all the periodic items, the state would not change worse in high probability. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets. Experimental results illustrate the advantages of our approach: PeriodicSketch using 1/10 memory can achieve around 77.3% higher Precision Rate, 74.4% higher Recall Rate, 3.1 times higher throughput, and up to 2019 times (737 times in average) lower Average Absolute Error in finding periodic items than the baseline solution. Additionally, our Cache prefetch experiment verify that PeriodicSketch can significantly improve the Cache hit ratio on several datasets.  
Our paper will appear in IEEE ICDE 2022. If you have any questions, please contact the following email: fanzc@pku.edu.cn or yangtongemail@gmail.com
